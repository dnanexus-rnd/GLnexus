  ## Why this is a problematic case
  The unified site spans multiple GVCF entries (for example, records that are split due to different sequencing depths). Although the input gvcf contain REF calls in those regions, these calls are lost as no single gvcf record covers the entire length of the unified site. (Note: This case is concerned with loss of purely REF calls in the input; loss of calls involving at least 1 ALT allele is considered in case join_vcf).

  ## Overcoming this problem
  In situations where multiple GVCF (REF) records span a unified site, we need a logic to “join” multiple gvcf records, such that the records span the entire length of the unified site. We then interpret the unified site as a REF call.

  ## Included example
  A.gvcf = samples with only REF calls
  B.gvcf; C.gvcf; D.gvcf = samples to suggest unified_site spanning gvcf entries in A

  ## Explanation on included sample
  Sample A has split gvcf ref entries across the unified site A:1000-1002, which can be joined to give a "correct" call of homozygous ref.

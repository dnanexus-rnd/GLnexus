  ## Why this is a problematic case
  The unified site coincides with an input vcf record, but contains a novel INDEL (typically DEL) that is not represented by the input vcf record. Reference padding around the input alleles is needed in order to represent the DEL that is present in the unified site.

  ## Overcoming this problem
  We need a logic to reference pad the input vcf record and fetch the appropriate (g)vcf records associated with the padded region to generate joined alleles that can be then used to map to discovered ALT alleles by querying the unification map.

  ## Included example
  A.gvcf = samples with vcf entries that does not fully span unified site
  B.gvcf; C.gvcf; D.gvcf = samples to suggest unified_site spanning "larger" unified site

  ## Explanation on included sample
  The unified site is of range A:1000-1001, which spans the original vcf entry in A.gvcf as well as the next gvcf entry to the right
